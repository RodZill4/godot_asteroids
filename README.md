This is my very first test with the Godot engine.

Since I'm definitely not an artist, I had to "borrow" the following:
- all sprites are from "Space Shooter" assets by Kenney Vleugels (http://www.kenney.nl)
- the music is part of Robson Cozendey "Sci-fi Music Pack" (http://www.cozendey.com)
- the font is D3-Globalism from DigitalDreamDesign (http://www.fontspace.com/digitaldreamdesign/d3-globalism)
- a huge part of my understanding of Godot came from Calum Knott's "building
  a space shooter" tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-x_sJVJQRQ)
